# Topic 4 Generating Data
## Do Loops
### Exmaple:
```
data DOLOOP;
DO i = 1 TO 100;
X = 3+5* RANNOR(59);
OUTPUT;
END;
RUN;
```
- no data is generated by ``` RANNOR(59)```. It has been created in a temporary file. If you want to see the data, or do an analysis, you must use PROC statement.
- the 59 in ``` RANNOR(59)``` is the seed, which will generate the same set of random number everytime we run this program. If we want to generate different number every time, we should specify seed as "0"

|SAS Code| Distribution|
|----    | ----        |
| RANBIN(seed, n, p)| Binomial, b(n,p))
|RANEXP(seed)|Exponential, Exp(1)|
| RANNOR(seed)| Standard Normal, N(0,1)|
|RANPOI(seed, m)| Posisson, Poisson(m)|
|RANUNI(seed)|Uniform, U(0,1)|
