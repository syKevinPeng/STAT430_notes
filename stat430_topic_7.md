# Topic 7a Sampling Distributions of Sample Means
## Statistical Inference Basic
1. Random Variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ form a simple random sample of size n if
   - The $X_i$'s are independent random variables.
   - Every %X_i% has the sample probability distribution.
2. Central Limit Theorm
    when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. 
3. The Law of Large Numbers
   As the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean.  That is , the difference between the sample mean and the population mean tends to become smaller (i.e., approaches zero).

# Topic 7b Sampleing Distributions
## Binomial Probability Distribution
### 1. Expected Value and Variance
Expect value: $E(X) = \mu = np$

Variance: $V(X)= npq = np(1-p)$

Standard Deviation: $\sigma_x = \sqrt{npq} = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$

Standard Error: $\sqrt(pq/n)$
## Sampling Distribution
- population parameter = $\mu$
- point estimate = sample mean = $xbar$
- standard error = $\sigma(x) = \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt(n)}$
