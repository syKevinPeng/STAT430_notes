# Topic 1 & 2 Introduction to SAS
## basic structure
data dataset_name;
input num_input string_input$;
datalines;
1
2
3
;
## Variabel Names
- must start with letter or underscore
- no longer than 32 char
- no special characters such as commas
- sas is not case sensitive
## **proc print**
```
proc print data=data_name;
title 'some title';
var var1 var2;
run;
```
## **proc sort**
```
proc sort data=data_name;
by subject;
run;
```
## **if statement**
```
data some_data;
input some_input;
if final GE 0 and final LT 41 then grade = 'F';
else if FINAL GE 41 AND FINAL LT 60 THEN GRADE="D";
datalines;
```
note:
- GE: greater or equal
- LE: less or equal
- GT: greater than
- LT: less than
## **proc freq**
```
proc freq data=some_data;
order = freql # order by frequency from high to low
table var1 var2 # here two tables are requested
run;
```
```
table var1 var2 / nocum; # no cumulative frequency
```
# Topic 3: Inputting data
## **infile statement**
```
data some_data;
infile 'path_to_file' delimiter = ',' dsd'
input
var 1
var 2
;
run;
```
note:
"dsd":
- ignores delimiters in data values enclosed in quotation marks
- does not read quotation marks as part of the data value
- threats two consecutive delimiters as a missing value
## coloumn input
```

restrictions:
- Each of the variable values in a data line must be in the same position in every data line. (Column Delimited)
- Numeric values include any necessary decimal points.
- Data doesnâ€™t include any dates or other values which need special treatment (such as numbers with commas)

Advantages over List Input:
- Spaces are not required between values.
- Missing values can be left blank
- Character data can have embedded spaces
- Skip unwanted variables

## formatted input
```
input
    var1 informat1
    var2 informat2
```
```
<$> informat-namew.<d>
```
- "\$": using a "$" indicates a character informat
- "w": total number of column positions to read
- ".": required delimiter
- 'd': number of decimal places if dealing with a quantitative variable

| format | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| $CHARw |   Reads w column positions of character data and preserves leading blanks. |
| COMMAw |  Reads w column positions of numeric data and removes selected nonnumeric characters such as dollar signs and commas. |  
|MMDDYY8. |Reads dates of the form 10/29/01 |
