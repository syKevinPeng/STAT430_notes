# Topic 6a Measures of Center
## Overview
###
1. Three characteristics of quantitative variables<br>
   - Shape - Visually via graphs
   - Center - Numeric summery
   - Spread - Numeric summery
2. Analyzing population versus analyzing samples<br>
   - For populations:
     - we know all data
     - parameters
     - using greek letters $\mu$
   - For samples:
     - we know part of data
     - statistics
     - using roman letters $\overline{x}$
## Center of the data
   1. Center of the data: Numeric values that represent the $\underline{average}$ or typical value of a quantitative variable.
  - example of measure central tendency:
    - mean and median<br>
 -  Properties of mean
    -  non-resistant measure of center (easily influenced by outlier)
 -  Properties of median
    -  resistant measure
2. Note: a fairly standard convention is to round the average to **one more decimal place than the data**
3. Note：One interpretation of the mean: The arithmetic mean can be thought of as the center of gravity.
4. Comparing Mean and Median
   1. Skewed left– mean will usually be smaller than the median. 
   2. Symmetric– mean will usually be close to the median.
   3. Skewed right– mean will usually be larger than the median.
## Variation or Meansures of Dispersion
Numeric values that represent the degree to which the values are $\underline{spread out}$.
  - examples of Meansures of Dispersion:
    - range, quaties, variance, standard deviation
